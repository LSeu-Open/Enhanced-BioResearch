## About this Repository

A curated list of repositories featuring articles, software, tools, pipelines, plugins, and more for biology research needs.

All the resources on this page are included on the assumption that you know how to code in Python and/or other languages, or that you're willing to learn. If you want to learn, I'll provide you with courses and links to help you at the bottom of this page.

The aim is to empower scientists like you to work more efficiently and effectively.

Please note that while this page offers valuable resources, it is not exhaustive and does not list all individual tools. Furthermore, inclusion in this collection does not imply full endorsement of every item listed.

We welcome contributions! Feel free to open a pull request (PR) to enhance the repository.

## AI usage in Science

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize science in several ways. AI can accelerate the pace of scientific discovery.  

By leveraging AI, scientists can formulate stronger hypotheses, conduct more experiments, and pursue bolder and more interdisciplinary research, ultimately leading to more efficient and innovative scientific discoveries

However relying too heavily on AI in scientific research can have both positive and negative consequences. 

Some potential drawbacks include:

- **Reduced Creativity and Critical Thinking**: Over-reliance on AI for decision-making and problem-solving may lead to a reduction in human skills such as creativity and critical thinking, limiting the ability to innovate and adapt to new situations.
- **Increased Bias and Inequality**: AI can perpetuate and amplify biases existing in the data it is trained on, potentially leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. This raises concerns about ethical implications and fairness in decision-making.
- **Ethical Concerns**: As AI becomes more sophisticated, it may be used to make decisions with significant ethical implications, raising concerns about transparency and ethical use of AI.

When using AI tools in scientific research, scientists should keep in mind the following considerations:
  
- **Responsibility and Limitations**: It's essential to use AI responsibly, understand its limitations, and ensure that human expertise remains central to the research process.
- **Data Security and Privacy**: Researchers should be aware of data security and privacy implications when using AI tools, especially in relation to data types and potential legal consequences in case of a data breach.
- **Bias and Discrimination**: AI tools can inherit biases, perpetuating stereotypes and discrimination in research outcomes. It's important to validate content using reliable resources and be mindful of potential biases.
- **Human Expertise**: While AI can enhance research, it's important to ensure that human expertise remains central to the research process and that AI is used as a tool to complement human capabilities.
