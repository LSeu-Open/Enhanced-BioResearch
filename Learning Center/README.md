## Python

### What is Python

Python is an open-source, high-level programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.

Python is versatile, supporting object-oriented, functional, procedural, and structural programming paradigms. This flexibility allows programmers to write clear, logical code for projects of any size.

Currently, Python has three major versions, with Python 3 being the latest. It boasts a vast library ecosystem, simplifying code development.

Let's explore why learning Python is worthwhile for scientists :

- **Versatility**: Python is a versatile language that can be used across various scientific disciplines, including biology, chemistry, physics, and environmental science. Its flexibility allows scientists to perform tasks such as data analysis, visualization, simulation, and modeling.
  
- **Ease of Learning**: Python's simple and readable syntax makes it accessible to scientists with varying levels of programming experience. This ease of learning enables researchers to quickly adopt Python for their scientific workflows.
  
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Python boasts a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools specifically tailored for scientific computing. Packages like NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn provide robust functionality for data manipulation, numerical computation, statistical analysis, and machine learning.
  
- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Python's popularity among scientists from diverse backgrounds fosters interdisciplinary collaboration. Researchers can easily share code, collaborate on projects, and leverage each other's expertise, leading to innovative scientific discoveries.
  
- **Open Source Community**: Python is supported by a vibrant open-source community that actively contributes to its development and maintenance. Scientists can benefit from community-driven resources, forums, and collaborative projects, enhancing their learning and problem-solving capabilities.
  
- **Reproducibility and Transparency**: Python promotes reproducible research practices by allowing scientists to document their analyses in code. This transparency facilitates peer review, replication, and validation of scientific findings, contributing to the integrity and credibility of research outcomes.

### A process to learn Python

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to learning a language like Python. What works well for one individual may be challenging for another, given the diverse backgrounds people come from. Instead of prescribing a specific method, I aim to offer a process to help you discover the most suitable learning path for your unique needs. Here is my process : 

:arrow_forward: **Before starting**  

Before diving into learning Python, it's crucial to establish your **motivations**. Having a clear goal in mind will keep you motivated throughout the journey, making the learning process more enjoyable and rewarding. It is also crucial to determine which **learning medium** suits you best. Some prefer guided tutorials with exercises, while others may prefer books, videos, or other resources. **PLEASE** take the time to choose carefully.

After addressing these critical points, some individuals may find it helpful to set a time goal (such as scheduling specific dates on your calendar) or establish a fixed number of learning sessions per week.

:arrow_forward: **Learn the basics**  

Gain a clear understanding of Python basics, including syntax, variables, data types, and functions. While theory is important, **practical application is key**. Take breaks as needed and engage in hands-on practice by writing simple code on your own. Take your time with the basics, as all subsequent knowledge will be built upon this foundation. 

Above all, **avoid getting stuck on a concept by yourself**, instead seek assistance from experienced Python developers to clarify concepts you find challenging. Otherwise utilize everyday metaphors, draw diagrams, watch videos, read example code and take the time to deconstruct it to gain a thorough comprehension of its workings.

Bassicly no path is wrong, as long as it fits your person. This is the stage of the learning journey where many people tend to drop out. Set **small, achievable goals** and allow yourself **enough time** to become comfortable with basic Python scripts.

:arrow_forward: **Apply the basics on real world problems**

Once you have grasped the basics, challenge yourself by undertaking a project to apply your newfound knowledge. Projects are instrumental in enhancing your skills and understanding. You can embark on structured projects spanning data science, machine learning, automation scripts, and more. There are numerous resources available, documentation, videos, tutorials amoungs others.

As you progress to advanced topics, consider working on projects of your own creation. Utilize available resources, but focus on projects that align with your **personal interests and goals**.

By this time, you must have learned to find errors and debug them.

:arrow_forward: **Figure out and learn which libraries i need for my usage of Python**

:arrow_forward: **Collaborate with others**

:arrows_clockwise: **Keep practicing**

### Ressources to learn python

i Will provide ressources here to avoid the difficult part of choosing a course. I consider Knowledge as human right so i will provide only free access content. As i said before, Keep in mind that for certain people (maybe you) it will be more appropriate to learn with a teacher in a physical course.
